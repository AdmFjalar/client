    <p className="about-me">
      I am Oliver, a Swedish software engineering student in New Zealand. I am
      passionate about privacy and security, and open-source software. I am a
      team-player, communicating my intentions and any uncertanties. I can also
      take on a leadership role when and where needed, guiding my team-mates and
      put their strengths to use while also allowing them to grow new skills. I
      have a background in game development, and I have a diploma in game
      development at LBS Kreativa Gymnasiet from 2017-2020, as well as a
      certificate of higher education from Solent Southampton University in game
      development. Since then, I have found my new passion in online safety. My
      wish is to work on sustainable and privacy-respecting solutions for
      people, making the online space safer for future generations.
